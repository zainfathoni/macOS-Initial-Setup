# macOS Initial Setup

My personal macOS setup guide for a new fresh installation

## Notes

This repository was ported from [Gist](https://gist.github.com/zainfathoni/51a508565f837e923671eb419deb2199) to [GitHub repository](https://github.com/zainfathoni/macOS-Initial-Setup) due to these reasons:

1. Gist does not support directories. ðŸ˜¢ I want to be able to customize my VS Code experience in this repository through configurations in a [`.vscode`](https://github.com/zainfathoni/macOS-Initial-Setup/tree/master/.vscode) folder.
2. The number of files are getting larger than I was planning. ðŸ˜…

Since I'm not pushing to the Gist repository anymor, from now on, **please refer to https://github.com/zainfathoni/macOS-Initial-Setup** for the most updated version of this guide.
