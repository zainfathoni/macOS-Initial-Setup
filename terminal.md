# Terminal Setup

Right after installing [iTerm2], you must be getting this prompt:

> The default interactive shell is now zsh.
To update your account to use zsh, please run `chsh -s /bin/zsh`.
For more details, please visit [Use zsh as the default shell on your Mac](https://support.apple.com/kb/HT208050).

As instructed, run `chsh -s /bin/zsh` to use `zsh` instead.
